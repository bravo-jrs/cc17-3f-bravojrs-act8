# BOOKSHELF

### Under Development

A simple application that shows a list of books and their covers. 

- Data was acquired via a Google API using Retrofit and Coroutines.
- Repository and Container patterns to manage the data and keep separation of concerns.
- Manual dependency injection was used to provide the data to the ViewModel.
- Junit for testing

COIL will be used for image display.
